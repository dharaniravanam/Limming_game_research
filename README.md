This game is similar to the classic puzzle computer game Lemmings. In Lemmings, the player must assign certain lemmings specific skills. If a lemming is not assigned a specific skill, they will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way, falling off any edges, and turning around if they hit an obstacle. By assigning specific skills to lemmings, they will aid in the passage of the other lemmings across the level. For example, a lemming can be told to dig, which might open up a new passage way around an obstacle. The goal is for the player to guide a certain percentage of the lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape.
