# Limming_game_research
An interactive, puzzle-based game, which is similar to Lemmings, to help students ranging from middle school to college juniors learn high-level concepts about the design phase of the software engineering life cycle. Object oriented design patterns are represented in our game in the form of actions that can be assigned to lemmings.
