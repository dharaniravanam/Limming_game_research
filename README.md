# Disaster Recovery Game
*A Serious Game for Learning Object-Oriented Design Patterns*

## 📌 About
Disaster Recovery Game is a **puzzle-based educational game** inspired by *Lemmings*.  
It teaches **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** through interactive gameplay rather than traditional coding.

Players guide lemmings across dangerous terrain by assigning them **roles** that represent how software objects communicate and collaborate.

---

## 🎮 How It Works
Lemmings automatically move toward the exit.  
The player places **helper lemmings** that control, guide, or modify how others behave.

Each helper represents a **software design pattern** used in real-world systems.

---

## 🧠 Design Patterns in the Game
- **Adapter** – Translates messages between lemmings  
- **Mediator** – Controls traffic and prevents collisions  
- **Observer** – Watches signals and reacts to changes  
- **Visitor** – Applies tools without changing lemming logic  
- **Iterator** – Repeats actions across multiple objects  

---

## 🛠 Game Tools
- 🪵 Plank – Cross gaps  
- ⛏ Pick – Break rocks  
- 🧹 Shovel – Dig paths  
- 🪓 Axe – Cut trees  

---

## 🎯 Objective
Help all lemmings safely reach the exit by making **correct design decisions**.  
Poor decisions result in failure — just like bad software architecture.
